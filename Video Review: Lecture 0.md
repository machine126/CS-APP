Instructor: Randal 

Overview:
>In-depth understanding of systems but more from a high level or programmers perspective

>Book : Computer Systems: a programmers'perspective =>Important.
Book and course tied together.

Philosophy:
	1. Learn realities rather than abstraction
	2. Step stone for further learning in specific
Great Reality #1
Ints are not Integers, Floats are not Reals.

Ex1: Is x^2>=0?
Float's(General): Yes
Int's : 
Running on terminal

Linux system is called GDB  while on Macintosh OS X, it's called LLDB 
Pretty much same things

Why?
Because the computer is expecting numbers to be represented as 32-bit values

Another example:

It not the right answer, right?

Ex 3 :
Is (x+y)+z = x+(y+z)?
>Unsigned & Signed int's :Yes
>Floats:
 (1e20 + -1e20)+3.14 ->3.14?


float: 相较于定点数，小数点的位置并不是固定的。
浮点数同样是由科学计数法来表示：
V = (-1)^S * M * R^E

S=> 0 postive 1 is negtive 
M=>尾数，用小数表示 比如8.345 *10^0 =>8.345 就是尾数
R=>基数 表示十进制R就是10，二进制R就是2
E=> 指数，用证书表示，比如10^-1 , -1就是指数

几eXX+几
科学计数法
E means exponent
aE+b =>
A*10^b
Ex: 
e+26 = 10^26
1e+1 = 10
